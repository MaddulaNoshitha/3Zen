    <p>Stress on service-orientation and social responsibility remains a significant component of our educational thrust. All first year students put in 50 hours of community service under the scheme ALERT. It is a mandatory requirement of the Degree Course. From 2012 an innovative programme called ALANA was added to provide more scope for the students to extend their services in the neighborhood schools.

        Religious Instruction for Christian students and Value Education for all others are part of the curriculum.</p>
